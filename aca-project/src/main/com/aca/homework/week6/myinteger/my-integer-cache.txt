Create a MyInteger class that holds an int value. Create a static factory named valueOf that takes a value and returns MyInteger. 
Cache MyInteger classes for values -100 to 100. 

e.g. if MyInteger.valueof(10) is invoked then the method should create and return a new object. If it is invoked once again then a new object should not be created but the old created one should be returned.
