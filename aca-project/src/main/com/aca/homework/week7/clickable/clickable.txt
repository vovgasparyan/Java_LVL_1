Create a Clickable interface that has click() and name() methods.

Create Button and Image classes that are Clickables.

Ask the user to create 5 clickable objects by typing the clickable name.

If the user typed a text that starts with 'button' then creates a Button that has the provided name.
If the user typed a text that starts with 'image' then creates an Image object that has the provided name.

e.g
Please type a clickable object name.
button1
The button object created having a name button1
Please type a clickable object name.
imageForBanner
The image object created having a name imageForBanner
..
..


After creating 5 clickable objects ask a user to type a clickable name to invoke click() method on it
e.g
Please enter a clickable name to invoke the click method.
imageForBanner
The click method is invoked on the Image object having a name imageForBanner

note:
Create an Action interface that has doAction(Clickable clickable) method.

Create an AbstractClickable class that implements the Clickable and in the constructor takes the Action object.

Both the Button and Image click method implementations should be forwarded to an Action object doAction(Clickable clickable) method.
