Create a ConnectionFactory class that has Connection getObject() method.

Create an Employee class that has the following fields.

String id;
String firstName;
String secondName;
Long salary;

Create CrudRepository<T, ID> interface that has the following methods:

void save(T t);
List<T> findAll();
T findById(ID id);
void deleteAll();

Create EmployeeRepository CrudRepository implementation that takes a ConnectionFactory in the constructor.
Implement all methods. (Fetch a new connection from the factory and close it once finished the DB interaction)

Create EmployeeRepositoryIntegrationTest and test all methods.

note: 
1) Do not use a reflection to generate SQL statements.
2) To fetch all Employees use executeQuery() method that returns a ResultSet. Assume that Employee always has the same columns count and the column's position is immutable.
