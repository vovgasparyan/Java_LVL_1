Create an AbstractPhoneService class that has 2 public abstract methods: 

Phone create(String imei, Model model);
Phone getByImei(String imei);


Create a PhoneService class that extends from AbstractPhoneService and has implementations of the abstract methods.

When a user passes an IMEI and model to the create method, PhoneService class creates a Phone object, keeps it in a private array, and returns the newly created object.

When a user invokes the getByImei method, PhoneService class finds and returns the Phone object out of the private array.

Implement the equals and toString methods of the Phone class.


Create a SAMSUNG phone via PhoneService having IMEI 351978946541895, also 
IPHONE, IMEI: 45678974132187
IPHONE, IMEI: 04894100487866
NOKIA,  IMEI: 99987741084444


invoke the getByImei method to find the phone having the IMEI 04894100487866 and print the phone.
