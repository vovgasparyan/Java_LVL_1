Create a List interface that has following methods.

void add(String element);
String get(int index);

Create an ArrayList implementation of the List interface that initially holds an empty 10 sized array of Strings.

When the add method invoked, the first element should be added at array[0], the second one at array[1] and so on.

if the get(0) method is invoked then the array[0] should be returned if it exists otherwise the RuntimeException should be thrown.

If the user invoked add method N times and we run out of an array empty spaces, the new array should be created with double size (2xN) and the old content should be copied to new one.
