Create a List interface that has following methods:

int size()
void add(Object o)
boolean isEmpty()
Object get(int index)

Create a FixedSizeList implementation that encapsulates a 10 sized array. When a user adds an 11th element ignore the operation and print 'The list is full' in the error stream.

Create static facttory methods in List interface named ofFixedSize() and ofEmpty().

ofEmpty static factory should return an anonymous implementation of the empty List interface.

note: if user added 2 items only he can not get the object for the given 2,3,4... indexes
